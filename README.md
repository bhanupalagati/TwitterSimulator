# TwitterSimulator
This project implements Twitter Simulator using F# and AKKA.NET

Distributed systems are too volatile and exceptionally hard to define theoritically. So, whenever we are building a distributed system it is advisable to build a simulation system which performs all the actions that our distributed system performs in a day to day life in large scale. This helps us to understand the practical limitations of the system.

This project is a simulator project for Twitter Clone project. https://github.com/bhanupalagati/TwitterClone

We have simulated a Twitter application with 30,000 users tweeting, retweeting, querying, subscribing, and message simulataneously.
